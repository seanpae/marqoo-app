      <strong><h3>Statement of Rights and
      Responsibilities</h3></strong>
      <p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (&quot;Statement,&quot;
         &quot;Terms,&quot; or &quot;SRR&quot;) is our terms of service that governs
         our relationship with users and others who interact with the Marqoo Mobile
         App (the “MMA”), as well as Marqoo brands, products and services, which we
         call the “Marqoo Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing the Marqoo
         Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in
         accordance with Section 13 below. Because the MMA provides a wide range of
         Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply
         to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent
         those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms
         associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your
         use of such app, product or service to the extent of the
         conflict.
      </p>

         <dt> Privacy</dt>
      <p><span>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed the Marqoo Data
         Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use the MMA to share
         with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We
         encourage you to read the Marqoo Data Policy, and to use it to help you
         make informed decisions.</span>
      </p>
      
         <dt> Sharing Your Content and Information</dt>
      <p><span>You own all of the content and information you post on the MMA,
         and you can control how it is shared. In addition:</span>
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like
            photos and videos (IP content), you specifically grant us a non-
            exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide
            license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with
            the MMA (the “IP License”). This IP License ends when you delete your
            IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with
            others, and they have not deleted it.
         </li>
         <li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to
            emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that
            removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of
            time (but will not be available to others).
         </li>
         <li>When you use an application, the application may ask for your
            permission to access your content and information as well as content
            and information that others have shared with you. We require
            applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that
            application will control how the application can use, store, and
            transfer that content and information
         </li>
         <li>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about the
            MMA, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions
            without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no
            obligation to offer them).
         </li>
      </ol>
      
         <dt> Safety</dt>

            functionality.
         </li>

         </li>
         <li>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we
            reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is
            appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username
            that does not closely relate to a user&#39;s actual name).
         </li>
      </ol>

         </li>
         <li>If we remove your content for infringing someone else&#39;s

            you with an opportunity to appeal.
         </li>

            consent, make it clear you (and not the MMA) are the one collecting

         </li>
         <li>In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number,
            you will update your account information on the MMA within 48 hours to
